I wrote these Haiku this morning. I was feeling about a hundred things and I just started writing them. They don't really read with each other well...they are independent.

Deep calls into deep: <br>
My Lord calls my broken heart. <br>
Make me whole again. <br>
 <br>
Brokenness I need <br>
But how can I deal with it? <br>
It breaks my heart so. <br>
 <br>
Alone, my heart cries. <br>
Be closer than a brother. <br>
Unto you, draw me. <br>
 <br>
Beautiful Jesus: <br>
Take my heart and seal it, <br>
Only in your grace. <br>
 <br>
You comprehend me, <br>
things I cannot understand <br>
Fill my God shaped hole. <br>
 <br>
Sinner, disgusting. <br>
My perfect inability. <br>
Help me find your grace. <br>
 <br>
Gracious you stole me, <br>
When I was full of inept. <br>
Thankyou great 'I am'. <br>
 <br>
Give me strength Jesus <br>
To make it through this great day <br>
Today is daunting. <br>
