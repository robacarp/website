This is a slow but reliable PIR Motion Sensor. The Lowes Iris line used Zigbee but has some proprietary preamble to the pairing process. Hubitat pairs them reliably enough, but has a special button for V1 Iris devices.

When they're available these motion sensors are _very_ cheap. I found a bag of 20 for $40.

Model number MOT801 or MOT901, from eBay. The run for about a year on a CR-123A 3 volt battery.

### Reset process:

- pull battery for 10s.
- insert battery.
- press tamper switch 8x with 1s interval to reset.
- LED will "pulse" or "heartbeat".

After reset, simply inserting the battery puts it into pairing mode.
