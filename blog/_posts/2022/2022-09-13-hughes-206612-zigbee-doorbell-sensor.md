I'm convinced that one of the best smart devices ever made is the Hughes 206612 Zigbee Doorbell Sensor. They're long out of production, but redily available on eBay for about $12 shipped.

This device easily wires into an existing doorbell chime and is simply represented as a zigbee switch which is momentarily flipped "on" when someone rings your doorbell.

It:

- Has no camera.
- Will run for _years_ on a single CR123A.
- Is small enough to fit inside most doorbell enclosures.
- Is Zigbee connected, not WiFi.
- Will send you a ping on your smart-tether when someone rings your doorbell.

In an age where literal entire subdivisions are being wired with Ring doorbells and Amazon has been known to sell Ring footage in bulk without a warrant, a slightly "dumber" doorbell is welcome.
