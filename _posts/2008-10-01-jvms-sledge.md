A recent forum post about diagnosing Java virtual machine problems stated this:

> No, it is NOT wrong to give up on the java package and write your own software.
>
> In fact, this has already been done. Search for Enrique's fine "skienforge" software. Written in python, it does almost everything the host software does. More in several cases. And all without the JVM headaches. [...]

This put me in an "I agree with you" rant mood...but I didn't feel it appropriate to vomit all over the forum.
