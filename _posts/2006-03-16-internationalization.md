The internationalization has begun!

I finally decided on for sure spending next semester in Luneberg, Germany.  My reason for going is simple: I want to learn.  I want to learn German, about traveling abroad, how it feels to be an outsider, how different we americans really are from the rest of the world, and whatever else I can from this experience.  My main goal will be to learn the language; that is what all my classes are going to be about.  In one semester, I plan to attack Beginning German I and II and Intermediate German I and II.  Pretty intense, right?  I hope so.  I am tired of learning all this useless nonsense.

That means that this blog (if you want to call it that) will be my main form of communication with many people.  I suppose that means that I will have to program a comments module for the system then.  Not too big of a deal, I was meaining to anyways.  Hopefully I will be able to use my new AJAX library!

Now I have a list of things to do:  Finish Pasport Application, Finish school application, Finish study abroad paperwork for FLC....lots of stuff to finish.  This is going to be a good exercise in dicipline for me: I am bad at procrastinating....not something that I can do with this project.
