Today I received my reprap electronics kits: all the kits required to get a [reprap](http://www.reprap.org) up and running. Its electronics kit mania! Woo hoo!

I have been watching the RepRap project since nearly its beginning in 2005 and since their release of Darwin landed nearly on my birthday I decided it was time to stop drooling all over my mouse and buy some parts.

Picture after the jump.
