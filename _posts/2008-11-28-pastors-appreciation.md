Prompt Via 22 Words

I am very thankful for my pastor. Here are some reasons why:

- He is biblical. Each and every sermon I have heard him preach is undoubtedly Biblical, challenging, thought-provoking and applicable.
- He is a good mentor. I have been mentored by him on many different occasions and have been challenged by his insight and wisdom. He continually uses scripture as a foundation for his suggestions.
- He makes the sacrifice of not making church his own 'show.' I compare the way he and his staff run the church services to other churches I have attended where the pastor is the local celebrity and I am thankful for his desire to be a conduit through which God speaks to the congregation. He makes it Gods 'show.'
