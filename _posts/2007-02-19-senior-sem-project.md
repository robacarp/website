Yesterday I was able to get my first common-anode, common-cathode led matrix running successfully.  I Used the Arduino 0007 my school purchased for me to experiment with and a Dallas Semiconductor Maxim 7219 Serial LED controller.


I shot a video with a hacked CVS camera and uploaded to Google videos:
Maybe I'll post my notes on figuring out the Maxim chip (It took me about 2 hours....but then again I wasn't really trying for the first bit).  Maybe.
