Its March 14, or 3-14. 3.14 is a special number in the mathematics world - the ratio of a circles diameter to its circumference. As it turns out there is all sorts of fancy things to be done with π. One of the most exciting things about π is its absolute refusal to be fully understood. It is an irrational constant - a decimal that never ends and never repeats.

One blogger made a [pi day trivet](https://www.evilmadscientist.com/2009/pi-pie-trivet/). Check out Wikipedia's [entry on pi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi).

Lets celebrate with a big π.
