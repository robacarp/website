Hitting ^L is the same as running the clear command

Hitting ^J is the same as a line-feed. This could come in handy when the shell is corrupt from a program crash.

The reset command is the savior of a corrupted shell. When the shell is really broken, use ^Jreset^J which will execute the reset command even when the enter key doesn't work.
