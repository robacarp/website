Honestly its kind of a long story.

Nevertheless I am not going to be spending a semester in Heidelberg, Germany as I had planned.  Hopefully someday I will get to go but I don't think that it will be during my time here at college.

I have lately been spending a lot of time browsing around websites such as [Make](http://www.diyhappy.com/) diyhappy and [hackaday](http://www.hackaday.com/).  I really like creating and hacking things together so I feel like the things on these websites are chock full of content that I just love to read.
