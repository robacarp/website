I have been working with an Arduino NG since its release date. Its a great little development board and its the only cheap way to start programming circuitry. I purchased mine from Spark Fun.

For my reprap project I decided that I don't want to stop playing with my Arduino just because it is going to be attached to a reprap. So I bought a kit for a Sanguino to put together specifically for my reprap. It is also the first of many electronic kits to be completed on the journey to the reprap.
