  <h3>Brief:</h3>
  <p>
    My name is Robert Carpenter.  I like to say that I make the internet.  I build web applications, automate servers, compile and analyze data, and query databases en masse. I wrote my first HTML page way back in 1997, and "published" on the now defunct geocities for several years.  I've been working professionally as a Software Engineer since 2007.
