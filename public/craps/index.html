<p><strong><em>I am a Christian.</em></strong></p>

<p>I choose not this path for happiness or some release from the day to day drone that occurs in society today. I don&#8217;t believe in a fluffy religion that claims to take all problems away. But I do believe in an all powerful God. A God who died a horrible death for the forgiveness of sins.</p>

<p>I try and live my life for God because I cant see the point in pouring myself fully into the things that I know to be only temporary.</p>

<p>My beliefs are (crudely) summed up like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>God exists and is perfect, omnipresent, omnipotent, entirely sovereign, and infinite among other things.</li>

<li>From the beginning God&#8217;s law has existed and since the fall of Adam we have not been able to satisfy the requirements of that law.</li>

<li>I am (and we all are) incapable of living a life that fulfills the requirements of Gods law.</li>

<li>Knowing this God sent His only Son to the earth to be the only fully perfect man. This man, Jesus Christ, lived a perfect and sinless life according to Gods Law and then died a most painful death, suffering the complete loneliness of sin, so that we may be forgiven.</li>

<li>In order to attain eternal life, we must accept Jesus&#8217; payment for our sins.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>I am a Musician.</em></strong></p>

<p>I have been playing percussion for about 12 years and now have just over 5 years expirence singing in choir. I am currently working on learning piano, though it is proving difficult to do without a piano in the house to practice on. I am going to learn guitar someday&#8230;.</p>

<p><strong><em>I am a Scholar.</em></strong></p>

<p>Learning is something that rings deep within my heart. I don&#8217;t think that I have found a subject that I didn&#8217;t want to learn. More than just learning I enjoy teaching people what I have learned and discussing the possibilities with people of all sorts.</p>

<p>I recently graduated from Fort Lewis College with a Bachelor of the Arts degree in Computer Science. Currently I am a teacher and &#8220;technology expert&#8221; at a private Christian middle/high school.</p>
